## Basic Git Commands

These are the commands you will use in every single project.

1. Initialise Git

`git init <project-name>`

2. Add files to the staging area

To add all files:

`git add .`

To add all files in a specific folder:

`git add src/posts/Git_Commands_Post`

To add one file:

`git add styles.css`

To add all files with a specific extension (in this case, all html files):

`git add *.html`

3. Check the staging area is correct before committing to Git

`git status`

4. Committing the changes to Git

`git commit -m "A short message describing the changes here"`

5. Push to remote repository (see below for how to set up remote repository)

`git push`

## Setting up a remote repository and pushing to Github

First we need to set up the repository on Github:

1. Go to github.com
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Select "New" to create a new repository
4. Type in your repository information. I always leave the "Add a README file", "Add a .gitignore" and "Choose a license" checkboxed unchecked.
5. Click Create repository

Now we need to connect up our local repository to the just-created Github repository:

6. Add the remote repository

`git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/Your-remote-repo-name.git`

7.  Ensure we are in the main branch

`git branch -M main`

8. Push your committed local code to Github

`git push -u origin main`

## Changing your username and email in Git

```
git config --global user.name "Danny Adams"
git config --global user.email "my-email@gmail.com"
```

## Undoing things in Git

To remove a file from staging (Removes the file only from the Git repository. The local, working directory copy of the file will remain intact.):

`git rm --cached <filename>`
